# Learning Journey on Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## Introduction

Welcome to my "Learning Journey on Domain-Driven Design (DDD)" repository. This is my personal exploration and documentation of learning, understanding, and implementing the principles and practices of Domain-Driven Design. The repository is designed as an open journal, mapping my progression from a beginner to a practitioner of DDD. Although this repo is my personal learning diary, progress and examples will be supervisioned by Marcin Sikorski @Sikora00 to ensure correctness and high standards so others can also learn from this source.

The idea for this repository came from my desire to learn DDD and the lack of structured resources without steep learning curve that could help me do so. I've found that most resources on DDD are either too theoretical or too practical. I wanted to create a repository that would help me understand the core concepts of DDD and how to apply them in real-world scenarios. By documenting my learning journey, I hope to help others who are also interested in learning DDD to be able to start learning it without problems.

This repository is a work in progress. I'll be adding more content as I learn more about DDD. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me.

I am utilizing wide range of knowledge sources, I will be keeping track of all the useful sources in /resource.md. I will also utilize the power of modern LLM's to my advantage for providing examples and explanations for my learning process. A lot of the content is my questions to AI and notes from the answers. I will be using tools like BARD and CHAT-GPT to help with my learning and documenting the process to be available in the most approachable way. So some of the content may be generated or edited by AI.

## Goals

- To understand the core philosophies and principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD).
- To learn how to effectively implement DDD in software development projects.
- To share my learning journey and progress under expert supervison with others.
- To create a repository of resources and references that can assist others in their DDD journey.

## Repository Structure

- **`/conceptual-overview`**: Contains my notes and understanding of the basic concepts and principles of DDD.

- **`/example-project`**: This directory will include the practical applications of DDD principles I've worked on, featuring real-world scenarios and how DDD can be implemented in them.

- **`/journal`**: Here you'll find the step-by-step tutorials and exercises I've followed and the insights I've gained from them.

- **`/sources`**: Contains the resources I've used to learn DDD, including books, articles, videos, and more.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore my learning journey. You can use this repository as a guide for your own DDD journey, or as a source of inspiration for documenting your learning in any area. You can:

- Follow my progress in the `/journal`.
- Learn from my insights and experiences documented throughout the repository.
- Explore the resources I've collected in the `/resources` directory.
- Use the code samples for your own projects or learning.

## Contributions

Your contributions to this learning journey are most welcome. If you've found a resource that could be useful, have some insights to share, or have suggestions to improve the repository, please feel free to make a pull request or open an issue.

## Disclaimer

This repository is a personal learning diary. While I strive for accuracy and also repo is under expert supervison (@Sikora00), there may be mistakes or misunderstandings. Please cross-check information and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

In addition, I'm not an expert in DDD. I'm just a beginner who's learning DDD and documenting my learning journey. I'm not affiliated with any of the resources or references I've used. I'm just sharing them because I've found them useful and hope they'll be useful to others as well. Also I am using tools like BARD and CHAT-GPT to help with my learning and documenting the process to be available in the most approachable way. So some of the content may be generated or edited by AI.
