## Journal Entry #2: What is tactical level DDD?

### Date: 17/05/2023

### Summary:

Today, I will be focusing on the tactical level of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). This is the part of DDD that zooms into the details. It's about applying specific patterns to implement the model inside each Bounded Context.

### Goals for this session:

1. Understand the basic of tactical level DDD
2. Understand the concepts of tactical level DDD
3. Prepare examples of tactical level DDD

### What is tactical level DDD?

Tactical level DDD is the detail-oriented part of Domain-Driven Design. While strategic design is about the big picture, tactical design is about the fine details.

Tactical design is like taking a magnifying glass to each Bounded Context. Inside each Bounded Context, we have a model that we need to implement. This is where tactical design patterns come in. These patterns provide a set of tools that we can use to build our model.

There are several key patterns in tactical DDD:

- Entities: These are objects that have an identity that doesn't change even if their attributes change. For example, a person might change their name or address, but they're still the same person.
- Value Objects: These are objects that don't have an identity. Their identity is based on their attributes. For example, a money object might be identified by the amount and the currency.
- Aggregates: These are clusters of Entities and Value Objects that can be treated as a single unit. They have a root entity, and consistency rules apply within the Aggregate.
- Repositories: These provide a way to store, retrieve, and search for Aggregates.
- Domain Events: These are events that domain experts care about.

In short, tactical level DDD provides a set of tools for implementing the model within each Bounded Context. By using these tools, we can create software that accurately reflects the business and is easy to understand and modify.


### Entities

In Domain-Driven Design, an Entity is a type of object that has a unique identity that remains the same even when its attributes change. Entities often represent meaningful concepts in the business domain that need to be tracked over time. For instance, in a banking application, a "Customer" could be an entity, having a unique ID and other attributes like name, address. Even if the customer changes their name or address, they're still the same customer because their unique ID remains the same.

Let's consider a simple example of an entity in a domain of an online store, representing a customer:

```typescript
class Customer {
  private _id: string;
  private _name: string;
  private _email: string;

  constructor(id: string, name: string, email: string) {
    this._id = id;
    this._name = name;
    this._email = email;
  }

  get id(): string {
    return this._id;
  }

  get name(): string {
    return this._name;
  }

  set name(newName: string) {
    this._name = newName;
  }

  get email(): string {
    return this._email;
  }

  set email(newEmail: string) {
    this._email = newEmail;
  }
}

// Creating a new customer entity
const customer = new Customer('1', 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');

// Changing the customer's name and email
customer.name = 'Johnathan Doe';
customer.email = 'johnathan.doe@example.com';
```

In this example, the `Customer` class is an entity with a unique identity represented by the `_id` property. The `_name` and `_email` properties are attributes that can change over time. The class encapsulates the behavior for getting and setting these attributes.

### Value Objects

In Domain-Driven Design, a Value Object is an object that doesn't have a distinct identity. Unlike Entities, Value Objects are defined by their properties or attributes and the values those attributes hold. If the attributes are identical, then the Value Objects can be considered equal, even if they are not the same instance.

For a real-world example, consider a "Money" Value Object in an online shopping application. A Money object could have two attributes: amount and currency. For example, $5 (amount) in USD (currency) is a distinct Value Object. If you had another Money object with $5 in USD, even though they're not the same instance, they are considered equal because their attributes and values are identical.

Here's a basic example in TypeScript:

```typescript
class Money {
  constructor(private amount: number, private currency: string) {}

  equals(other: Money): boolean {
    return this.amount === other.amount && this.currency === other.currency;
  }
}

const fiveDollars = new Money(5, 'USD');
const anotherFiveDollars = new Money(5, 'USD');

console.log(fiveDollars.equals(anotherFiveDollars)); // Outputs: true
```

In this example, even though fiveDollars and anotherFiveDollars are different instances, they are considered equal because their amount and currency attributes are identical.

### Aggregates

Aggregate is a pattern that helps us ensure the consistency of changes to objects in the business domain. 

An Aggregate is a group of related objects that are treated as a single unit. This group consists of one or more Entities, and possibly Value Objects. All of these objects together form a single conceptual whole, where one Entity leads as the "root," and the others are encapsulated within this root.

The root Entity has a global identity, meaning it can be directly accessed and referenced by other objects. The other objects inside the Aggregate can only be accessed through the root. The root is also responsible for maintaining the integrity of the Aggregate, ensuring all its rules or invariants are satisfied.

A real-world example of an Aggregate might be an Order in an e-commerce system. The Order could be the Aggregate root, with a unique order ID. It could contain several OrderLineItem objects, each representing a product in the order and the quantity ordered. When you add a new OrderLineItem, the Order Aggregate could check if the total order value exceeds a customer's credit limit, maintaining business rules.

Example of this:

```typescript
class OrderLineItem {
  constructor(public productId: string, public quantity: number) {}
}

class Order {
  private lineItems: OrderLineItem[] = [];

  constructor(public orderId: string) {}

  addLineItem(item: OrderLineItem) {
    this.lineItems.push(item);
    // Here we could enforce some rules, e.g., the total quantity must not exceed a certain value
  }

  getLineItems(): OrderLineItem[] {
    return this.lineItems;
  }
}

// Usage
const order = new Order('order1');
order.addLineItem(new OrderLineItem('product1', 2));
```

In this code, Order is an Aggregate root, and OrderLineItem is part of the Aggregate. Any modifications to the Order or associated OrderLineItems are made through the Order, ensuring consistency and integrity of the Aggregate.

### Repositories

Repository is a pattern that provides a way to obtain references to, find, and store Aggregates. Repositories act like a collection of Aggregates, hiding the details of how data is persisted, retrieved, and stored.

A Repository might provide methods for adding, removing, or retrieving Aggregates. Repositories should provide methods that align with the needs of the domain and its use cases, which might include finding Aggregates that meet certain criteria.

For instance, in an online shopping system, you might have an OrderRepository. This repository would provide methods for storing and retrieving Order Aggregates, possibly offering methods to find Orders by customer ID, status, or date range.

```typescript
class OrderRepository {
  private orders: Order[] = []; // This is simple example with array instead of data source.

  save(order: Order): void {
    this.orders.push(order);
  }

  findById(orderId: string): Order | undefined {
    return this.orders.find(order => order.orderId === orderId);
  }

  findAll(): Order[] {
    return this.orders;
  }
}

// Usage
const orderRepository = new OrderRepository();

const order = new Order('order1');
order.addLineItem(new OrderLineItem('product1', 2));

orderRepository.save(order);

console.log(orderRepository.findById('order1'));
```

In this code, `OrderRepository` is a repository for `Order` Aggregates. It provides methods to save an Order, find an Order by its ID, and find all Orders. The actual data storage mechanism (in this case, an in-memory array) is abstracted away from the client code.

### Domain events

Domain Events are a key concept in Domain-Driven Design. They are a representation of a significant happening in the domain. When a state changes in the system that is of interest to other parts of the system, a Domain Event is raised. It's a way to communicate between different parts of the system in a decoupled manner.

Domain Events are different from system events or application events in that they represent something meaningful within your domain, not technical events like a button click or a file save.

For instance, in an e-commerce system, when an order is placed, it might raise an `OrderPlaced` Domain Event. This event could then be used to trigger various actions elsewhere in the system, like sending a confirmation email to the customer, updating the inventory system, notifying the shipping department, etc.

Here's a simple TypeScript example:

```typescript
class OrderPlaced {
  constructor(public readonly orderId: string, public readonly orderDate: Date) {}
}

class Order {
  //...

  place() {
    // logic to place the order
    //...

    // raise domain event
    return new OrderPlaced(this.orderId, new Date());
  }
}

// Usage
const order = new Order('order1');
const event = order.place();

// Handle the event in Event Handler
if (event instanceof OrderPlaced) {
  console.log(`Order ${event.orderId} placed at ${event.orderDate}`);
}
```

In this code, the `Order` Entity raises an `OrderPlaced` Domain Event when the order is placed. This event can then be handled elsewhere in the system to trigger other actions.
