### Journal Entry #5: Deep Dive into Bounded Contexts

#### Date: 20/05/2023

#### Summary:

In this entry, I will take a closer look at one of the most critical concepts in the strategic design of Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Bounded Contexts. Bounded Contexts are a central pattern in DDD. They help to divide a large model into smaller, more manageable parts.

#### Goals for this session:

1. Understand the deep concept of Bounded Contexts.
2. Learn how to identify and define Bounded Contexts in a business domain.
3. Understand the relationship between Bounded Contexts and other DDD patterns, such as Ubiquitous Language.
4. Discover strategies for dealing with the interaction between different Bounded Contexts.

### Journal Entry #5: Deep Dive into Bounded Contexts

#### Introduction:

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Bounded Contexts are an essential part of strategic design. They help to divide large, complex domains into more manageable parts, each with its own Ubiquitous Language and carefully defined interfaces. A Bounded Context is essentially a boundary within which a particular model is defined and applicable. In a way, they are a means to tame complexity in large systems.

#### The Importance of Bounded Contexts:

The importance of Bounded Contexts cannot be understated in a business domain. Bounded Contexts are the answer to a crucial issue in large systems, which is that different parts of a system might use the same term to mean different things. By defining Bounded Contexts and an Ubiquitous Language within those contexts, we can ensure that each term in our model has one, and only one, meaning within that context.

Moreover, Bounded Contexts make it easier to maintain the model over time. Without well-defined boundaries, it can be challenging to prevent the model from becoming a large, unmanageable mess.

#### Identifying Bounded Contexts:

Identifying the boundaries of a Bounded Context can be challenging. It requires a deep understanding of the domain. One way to identify Bounded Contexts is to look at changes in the language. If a particular term means different things in different parts of the system, it's a good indication that you have different Bounded Contexts.

Also, consider how changes affect the system. If a change in one part of the system doesn't affect another, it's a strong sign that they are separate Bounded Contexts.

#### Bounded Contexts and Ubiquitous Language:

The relationship between Bounded Contexts and the Ubiquitous Language is very intimate. Within each Bounded Context, there is a single Ubiquitous Language. This language is used by all team members, from domain experts to software developers, ensuring that everyone has a shared understanding of the model.

#### Interaction Between Bounded Contexts:

Despite the fact that each Bounded Context is a self-contained unit with its own Ubiquitous Language, there are often needs to interact between them. This interaction can be challenging due to differences in language and model.

There are several strategies for dealing with this, such as:

1. **Shared Kernel**: A shared kernel is a common model that is shared between two or more Bounded Contexts. It's a way to share parts of the model where it makes sense, while keeping other parts isolated.

2. **Customer-Supplier**: In this relationship, one Bounded Context (the Customer) depends on the outputs of another (the Supplier). The Supplier team must consider the needs of the Customer team but is not as closely tied to their model.

3. **Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)**: An ACL acts as a translator between two Bounded Contexts with different models. It converts requests from one context's model to the other's and vice versa, ensuring that neither context is "corrupted" by the other's model.

In conclusion, Bounded Contexts are a powerful tool for managing complexity in large systems. They help us keep our models clean and our teams focused, while still allowing for necessary interaction between different parts of the system. Understanding and correctly implementing Bounded Contexts can be a major step towards a successful Domain-Driven Design approach.

#### 1. Shared Kernel

In the case of a `Shared Kernel`, let's assume that `Order` and `Inventory` bounded contexts agree on sharing certain types of `Product` information:

```typescript
// shared-kernel/product.ts

export class ProductShared {
  constructor(public id: string, public name: string) {}
}
```

This shared class could be used in both bounded contexts, but they should agree not to change this class independently, as it would affect the other context.

#### 2. Customer-Supplier

In a `Customer-Supplier` scenario, the `Order` bounded context (customer) depends on the `Inventory` bounded context (supplier) to check product availability. The `Inventory` context must ensure it serves the needs of the `Order` context, so it exposes an API to fetch the required product information:

```typescript
// inventory/application/services/inventory.service.ts

export class InventoryService {
  constructor(private productRepository: ProductRepository) {}

  async getProductAvailability(productId: string): Promise<number> {
    const product = await this.productRepository.find(productId);
    return product.quantity;
  }
}
```

The `Order` bounded context can use this service to check product availability:

```typescript
// order/application/services/order.service.ts

export class OrderService {
  constructor(private inventoryService: InventoryService) {}

  async createOrder(createOrderDto: CreateOrderDto): Promise<Order> {
    // Verify product availability
    for (const item of createOrderDto.orderItems) {
      const quantity = await this.inventoryService.getProductAvailability(
        item.productId
      );
      if (quantity < item.quantity) {
        throw new InsufficientProductQuantityException();
      }
    }
    // Proceed with order creation
    // ...
  }
}
```

#### 3. Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)

For the `Anti-Corruption Layer`, suppose the `Inventory` bounded context changes its model and now requires a `ProductRequest` object instead of a simple product ID:

```typescript
// inventory/application/services/inventory.service.ts

export class ProductRequest {
  constructor(public id: string, public location: string) {}
}

export class InventoryService {
  async getProductAvailability(request: ProductRequest): Promise<number> {
    // Fetch product based on id and location
    // ...
  }
}
```

The `Order` bounded context doesn't care about product location, so we can introduce an Anti-Corruption Layer to handle this transformation:

```typescript
// order/application/services/acl/inventory-adapter.service.ts

export class InventoryAdapterService {
  constructor(private inventoryService: InventoryService) {}

  async getProductAvailability(productId: string): Promise<number> {
    // The Order context only cares about product id
    // The location is handled within the ACL
    const request = new ProductRequest(productId, "default");
    return this.inventoryService.getProductAvailability(request);
  }
}
```

The `OrderService` then uses `InventoryAdapterService` instead of `InventoryService`:

```typescript
// order/application/services/order.service.ts

export class OrderService {
  constructor(private inventoryAdapterService: InventoryAdapterService) {}

  async createOrder(createOrderDto: CreateOrderDto): Promise<Order> {
    // Verify product availability
    for (const item of createOrderDto.orderItems) {
      const quantity = await this.inventoryAdapterService.getProductAvailability(item.productId);
      if (quantity < item.quantity) {
        throw new InsufficientProductQuantityException();
      }
    }
    // Proceed with order creation
```
